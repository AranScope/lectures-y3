# LT1 - Intro
The code is written using the ROS indigo framework using Python, the robots have a depth camera. We will be using SVN version control.

It's worth having reporty people in your team.

## Learning outcomes
1. Program autonomous robots
2. Implement signal processing and control algorithms
3. Describe and analyze robot processes
4. Write technical reports
5. Use experimental methods

## Exercise points
All of the coursework needs to be experimentally evaluated using suitable scientific methods
- How it failed?
- Why did it fail?
- In what circumstances does it fail?
- You need to justify any choices you make
- Evidence based engineering
- Statistical analysis

## Moravec's Paradox
- *Easy* - Mathematics, Chess, Expert systems
- *Hard* - Seeing, Conversation, Walking

What's easy for humans is hard for robots and vice versa.
